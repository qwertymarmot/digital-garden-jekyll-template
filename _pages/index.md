# Welcome to the Garden! ðŸŒ¿

Hello my name is Brandon. I am an application support administrator and a department manager for an organization that provides IT support and services to libraries.

I am also a student finishing up my Computer Information systems degree through online classes.

My digital garden aims to solve my problem of unconnected knowledge and notes that get lost to time. Traditional organization methods leave little room for connections between thoughts and ideas.

This garden provides loose organization to facilitate for whimsy and serendipity of thought. I collect information from many different sources such as Articles, Books, Online classes, and Videos.

This digital garden is also influenced by my early grasp of [[ZettelKasten]] systems. My notes system collects information first in Obsidian. From there as notes grow and connect I will upload them to my garden to continue growing publicly. The end goal is a knowledge warehouse that doesn't loose it's value overtime.
