Hello my name is Brandon. I am an application support administrator and a department manager for an organization that provides IT support and services to libraries.

I am also a student finishing up my Computer Information systems degree through online classes.

Something that started to frustrate me when I started classes was the note taking methods I had learned all through grade school. These note taking methods created a habit of containerizing notes and ideas to classes. Containerization popular in how we organize other bits of information in file and folders. This containerization make so that ideas were unable to connect and grow off of each other.

Because ideas could not connect it limited my learning. I was unable to carry over knowledge from one class into another class. This just was inefficient and carried over into my note taking outside of those educational institutions as well.

My journey began to find a better way to take notes. This is where the concept of [[Zettelkasten|What is a ZettelKasten]] and [[Digital Gardens]] comes in. The goal is to make notes that can continue to grow and influence each other. I am then able to foster a continual knowledge warehouse that doesn't loose value.

My system is to first collect notes in Obsidian and leave those private. From there I will upload notes that I want to grow publicly here into my Digital Garden.
