# My Name is Brandon Cole

I am driven by the constant pursuit of personal optimization. This pursuit leads me to read books and articles in an attempt understand various concepts related to physical and mental health, emotional intelligence, communication, leadership, technology, data analysis, and many others.

Ideally you will be able to watch and grow with me in these areas as I cultivate my digital garden further.

Knowledge is personal and is influenced so heavily by the content we ingest and the people we interact with. This knowledge is by no means complete or representative of any final truth. I welcome content and discussion to influence these ideas to cultivate them further.

I hope that you find value in exploring these thoughts and ramblings. If you have any questions please let me know.
