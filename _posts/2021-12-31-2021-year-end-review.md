## Finishing the battle with infertility
Wow, what a year. It is hard to believe everything that happened in my life this year. We started 2021 in Denver for the egg harvest part of our IVF process. We spent about a week staying in a hotel since we had daily appointments. Since Denver was still very much closed down, we spent considerable time in the hotel room. I was able to set up a mobile workstation to still do my work remotely.
In the IVF process, they collected nine eggs, of which three were fertilized and one that was genetically normal. We were lucky because the one embryo was a high-quality one. To be honest, this was a bit terrifying. We had gone through so much, and only having one chance was terrifying. We also learned that there was a 98% chance of a female.
We spent the next few months after January running through some preparation and a dry run of the embryo transfer process. This allowed the doctors to fine-tune the timing and medication for the optimal time to transfer the embryo to my wife. With everything dialed in, we finally did the transfer in March, and the doctors confirmed a positive pregnancy a few weeks later.

## Buying a new house
Also, at the beginning of the year, we decided to move out of our previous house into something with a bit more space and an established yard. We both wanted more freedom and something easier to maintain. We closed on our new home in March as well. We have enjoyed our new space all year long.

## New Jobs
My wife decided in the spring to take a year off of teaching to escape the stress of the education system. She obtained a job coordinating DJ events with a local business that provides DJ services for weddings and other events. She has enjoyed the low stress, and it has been great for the pregnancy.
My photography side business grew exponentially this year. I shot five weddings, numerous family sessions, and four newborn sessions. I continued to develop my photography skills and learn new skills and techniques to improve my photos. Already I have three weddings booked for next year. I realized that I wanted to limit weddings to about five sessions per year since they are much work. They are a good challenge that I am successful at. I want to offer a great product and continue to learn and improve without becoming complacent.

## Focusing on health
Around October, I started thinking about my cardiovascular levels or the lack thereof more appropriately. I've always struggled to find a type of cardio exercise I enjoyed. I never felt like I could get into running. I tried a stair climber for a bit but couldn't keep the habit going. Anyhow back in October, I decided to try cycling. I found a bike and an indoor trainer. It all started from there. I now use Zwift to continue my workouts, and I've been going strong for the last several months. I have been enjoying the exercise, and I can tell the difference it makes in my health and stamina. I can breathe a lot easier and get winded as easily. It is my goal to continue growing my health. I want to do this for my daughter. Other than that, I've continued making my sleep habits a priority. I've been getting to bed around 10 pm each night and waking up at 7 am every morning. This has helped me get caught back up on sleep and avoid sleep deprivation. Overall these choices have helped me become more apparent and productive. I've also been focusing on my breathing using the lessons I learned from the book [[Breathe]]. I believe these lessons have helped in my exercise substantially as well. Lastly, I made a lot of efforts to meditate throughout the year. I've been using the headspace app and enjoy it. I haven't been as consistent in my meditation as I want to be, so that is one area I intend to focus on in 2022.

## Continuing education
I continued to work on my education through online college classes to finish my bachelor's degree in computer information systems. I continued to work full time and go to school full time. I kept up with all my school work and maintained a 4.0 GPA. I learned so much this year. I challenged myself with 60-page reports, databases, and PHP web applications that I never dreamed I could pull together. With only one semester left in 2022 to graduate, I am excited about the future.

## Not all positive though
With all of these positives in the year, it is hard not to reflect and consider how blessed we have been. There were some negatives and sad parts of the year. For one, my wife's mother got in a pretty severe car accident while visiting Michigan. We had to travel up there to the hospital to be her home with us to recover a bit. She has had to deal with a lot of the fallout of that accident and will likely continue dealing with it for a while to come.
We also had to let our beautiful white lab Maya go. She was 15 years old and was suffering from a failing liver. We loved her so much, and it was so hard to see her having trouble in the end. We were so blessed to have had her with us to brighten our lives. I can only hope that we gave her the best life possible.


2021 has been a whole year, and reflecting it is so crazy that so much has happened in this one year. I'm so excited for 2022 and all the blessings coming our way. I'm thrilled to meet my daughter and be challenged to be the best dad possible. Come at us 2022. We are ready.
