title: I have been thinking wrong about productivity
tag: discussion
---
Have you ever read something and had your world turned upside down? I've been experiencing that feeling as I have been reading the book [[Deep work: rules for focused success in a distracted world]]. See I went into this book thinking that productivity was all about optimization. Using electronic tools to produce more and in a faster way. I will admit I am only about a hundred pages into reading this book so I have a lot more to process. However what I am picking up so far is a call to lower the drive toward the optimization processes I have been pursuing and instead focus on deep work and mastering skills.
I think one of the points made in the book that I attached to the most was the concept of how the majority of people take the path of least resistance. Rather than pursuing deep work and mastery of skills we learn just enough to get us by. However as business and technology progress it will be the people who are masters of certain skills that will be in higher demand. This also made me think of how optimization leads to automation. So it made me worry that as I optimize my workflow further it gets to a point where my work could be replaced by a computer or machine. Instead of optimization I am thinking more about the process of taking time to learn crucial skills that makes me more valuable and allows my output to increase as well.
I am looking forward to reading further into this book and the potential of shaking up other areas of my processes and mindset.
