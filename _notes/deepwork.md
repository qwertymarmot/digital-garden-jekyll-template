## Notes
### Part 1 The Idea
- As technology advances more jobs will be replaced by machines. In the cases of jobs that require humans in many cases remote work opportunities will allow businesses to hire stars rather than local workers thus leaving the local talent unemployed and underemployed
- Those who can work with and understand data from smart machines will thrive as the digital divide increases
- In order to be part of the group that masters hard things you must be willing to do it again and again as the technology changes
- American culture thrives on the idea of prodigy rather than practice
- Trying to learn a skill while distracted by other things like Facebook causes multiple unlinked neurons to activate which reduces the ability of the ones needed for the skill to develop
- Research has identified a kind of lingering affect from our tasks. As we move from task to task there is some residual brain power still focused on the original task
- Some higher level executives live in a highly distracted state because that it where they contribute best to the organization. However most others should not aim to idolize this style of work as it is not sustainable in other levels
- Trends that "increase" productivity of the business limit individual ability to focus on deep work to learn new things
- We pursue a work force driven by our inboxes and our meetings because it is easier than other methods of work prioritization. However when we measure productivity by the number of emails or meetings we do then the true potential of each individual is lost.
- Efficiency and speed of task completion has lead to busyness. We have begun to believe that this indicates success but in reality it moves us more replaceable by another person or machine.
- I've been so wrong about productivity
- Because the business push is for these productivity areas it becomes more and more easy for a person who knows how to focus on deep work to learn new skills and become a top performer in their industry.
- Something we generally find is that craftsman require depth to hone their crafts. They don't have to deal with email and other distractions. This allows them to become masters over time.
- Contrary to popular belief the outcomes of large scale are not necessarily as important to our well being as what we focus our attention on. People with a fatal medical diagnosis can be happy by focusing on what makes them happy rather than the diagnosis.
- Many emails that we respond to throughout the day are fairly shallow in content. So building habit to focus on these shallow concerns ensures our will power will be mostly taken up by these shallow issues.
- According to the work of Czikszentmihalyi we are happier when we are in a state of [[Flow]]. This really only occurs when we do something challenging over an extended period of time.

### Part 2 The Rules
- Our willpower is finite and cannot focus on deep work forever. Eventually it is inevitable to give into distraction.
- Because our willpower is limited we must start a new practice or habit of deep focus utilizing routines and consistency to make it a part of our everyday life.
- The monastic method to deep work is the most radical and shuns almost completely any form of shallow work that could come. This method tends to apply best to novelists who can avoid email and meetings or other distractions.
- The bimodal method is a split of substantial periods of time between deep work and shallow work. Sabbatical for an academic might be a good example of bimodal. It can also apply to someone who is able to take a few days per week for deep work only
