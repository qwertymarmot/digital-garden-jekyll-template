## Notes
- The mindset of never having enough is a leading cause to our shifting mindsets and our attitudes about everyone. Nevermind having enough sleep, money, success, time puts us in a impossible to catch up negative state.
- Our benchmarks for which we compare ourselves against are unobtainable and thus continue to drive us into a state of lacking
- Fear thrives in a culture of scarcity. This fear turns us all into animals backed into a corner and ready to explode at anyone who threatens our beliefs. It also makes us susceptible to confirmation bias
- Being vulnerable is difficult because it is us putting ourselves out there and accepting the risks that come. However being vulnerable is how we grow and how we learn to be better and more empathetic people.
- We are only able to be vulnerable with those who we trust.
- Trust is built up over many small moments. Each time someone does something to show they care it increases our trust of that person. Each time they do something to wrong us that trust is deminished or destroyed altogether.
- Addressing shame is a critical part of being vulnerable. Shame breeds in silence. It grows bigger and stronger. A business cannot cultivate a culture of innovation and growth with shame because ideas aren't shared.
- A process for shame resilience is to respond to the voice in your head with the reasoning for why it is fine to for you to behave in a specific way.
- As we grow up around the time we are in middle school is the times when we start to put on masks and armor to conform in order to fit in. As adults we have wore these masks and armor for so long we have gotten excellent at hiding the facts that they exist. Peeling away this amor is difficult and induces shame
- Living in a state of expecting the worse lowers the joy we can experience from the happy moments in our lives. We convince ourselves that expecting the worst will prepare us. But when the worst actually happens we will never be prepared for it anyhow so life is better lead embracing the happy moments
- Perfectionism is a form of shame where we try to avoid failure. However avoiding failure limits our ability to grow and in itself is a failure. We have to be willing to failure to learn.
- Our battle against Perfectionism is believing that we are enough. Being enough entails wholeheartedly accepting and embracing your self and the flaws that make you one of a kind.
- When we pursue numbing agents or ways to take the edge off our life or our day we avoid the real problems. Address the issues that make you feel like you need numbing in the first place. Many times they can be corrected in one self.
