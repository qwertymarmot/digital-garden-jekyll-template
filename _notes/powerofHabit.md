## Notes
- Habits can carry on even through partial brain damage involving areas of memory. This proves that habit happen in an almost automatic sense.
- As we develop habits our brains require less and less work to accomplish the same tasks. This encourages the brain to become more efficient.
- Habit loops explain how some tasks become so much easier over time than they are the first time. Such as driving a car. It also explains how we can think about other things as we are driving.
- We never really lose old habits. They are still there waiting for the right cue and reward to start up again. This explains why we don't have to consistently learn things all over again.
- Some habits we don't realize are forming until it's too late. Fast food habits can grow exponentially as long as the cues and rewards remain. For example driving home, kid says I'm hungry. Adult mind thinks fast food.
- To control our habits we have to become aware of the cues and rewards that our minds are running on
- In some cases we can't recognize a cue because we have become so used to it. That is the case of febreze where people get used to the smells in their lives and no longer notice certain persistent smells.
- As a habit becomes strong enough if we get the cue and follow with the action but the reward is delayed or withheld we will get angry or quit the habit
- Cravings are also a form of a habit. We may not know what the cue was but it happened and the craving is our body expecting the reward.
- A way one might change a habit is to change the routine associated with a cue and a reward. Rather than drinking at a bar AA makes a bar like atmosphere where alcoholics can share their worries and their stress with friends who can provide understanding
- In order to change a bad habit and not fall back into it when under stress or anxiety it is important to have a belief in something other that yourself to help keep you going.
- Belief in change is easier with a group or community supporting you. This happens when someone goes through a tragedy and makes drastic changes in their life with the support of a community of others. It also explains how money changes in life occur after the I've had it moments that Dave talks about
- There are keystone habits that when changed trickle down to affect other habits as well.
- Willpower is a finite resource. As we have to use our will power throughout the day it becomes much easier to give into the least smart decisions at the end of the day.
- We can grow our willpower like a muscle. As we become more disciplined in one area of our lives it tends to overflow into other areas as well. For example as I ride my bike more I also do better at work and in school.
- If you can ask yourself little questions about how your day will go. What you will do, you will be able to create achievable goals and routines to accomplish those goals.
- Studies show that employees who are given autonomy and feel like they guide their own decisions make better choices because they retain more will power than when they are forced to do something. #leadership
- A business is a place of war where truces are made so everyone can get work done. This occurs because in a business there are limited resources and when those resources are not allocated to a specific department it might make them upset. This leading to an unbalanced workplace. Truces are created to allow for give and take. When these truces are one sided the business will eventually falter.
- Social ties and peer pressure are great motivators in getting a group to do something. These social community habits explain the success of the Montgomery bus boycott and numerous other events I'm histrory.y
- Some habits can become so strong that we have very little conscious control over them. Sleep walking and some kind so addiction can be caused by habits
